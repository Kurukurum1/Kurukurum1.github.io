# WORK EXPERIENCE
Versuni (China) Investment Co., Ltd.   
(Philips Home Appliances (China) Investment Co., Ltd.)             Shanghai, CHN  
Consumers and Market Insight Intern, DA Marketing Department	   06/2023-08/2023  

Extracted and processed sales data using Python and conducted a post-product  
launch review of a new Philips air fryer, based on data from the backend of two  
Chinaâ€™s major e-commerce platforms, Tmall and JD.com.   
Performed analyses in R (dplyr, ggplot2) to decompose air fryer sales by week,    
channel, and customer segment, identified high-value cohorts that accounted for    
40% of revenue.  
Packaged findings into deliverable visual reports (static and interactive  
dashboards) and handed off data products and key metrics to stakeholders to  
support A/B test design and pricing model development.

# PROJECTS
Banking Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis  
Developed  algorithms for telecommunications service vendors to predict customer  
churn probability based on labeled data via Python programming and ApacheSpark.  
Preprocessed data set by data cleaning, categorical feature transformation and  
standardization, etc.  
Trained  supervised  machine  learning  models  including  Logistic  Regression,  
Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, and applied regularization with optimal  
parameters to overcome overfitting.  
Evaluated model performance of classification (accuracy 0.86) via k-fold  
cross-validation technique and analyzed feature importance to identify top  
factors that influenced the results.  

Customer Reviews Analysis and Topic Modeling  
Clustered customer reviews into groups and discovered the latent semantic  
structures using Python.  
Preprocessed review text by tokenization, stemming, removing stop words and  
extracted features by Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF).  
Trained unsupervised learning models of K-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet  
Analysis.
Identified latent topics and keywords of each review for clustering.  
Visualized model training results by dimensionality reduction using Principal  
Component Analysis (PCA).

Supply Chain demand forecasting and data management  
Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict future demand of  
different nutrition products for a pharmacy store.  
Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessed the data including handling  
missing values and special treatment on new product without any sales history.  
Built LASSO regression and random forest models, evaluated the models via    
10-fold cross validation and found optimal model parameters via grid search.  
Selected the best model based on mean absolute error.
